# Fyne Writer

An AI-powered Markdown writing tool with a custom WYSIWYG editor, built
in Go on the [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) toolkit.

## Run

Requires Go 1.22+ and an API key from at least one provider.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and/or OPENAI_API_KEY
go build -o fyne-writer ./cmd/fyne-writer
./fyne-writer
```

`./fyne-writer --check-ai` runs a one-shot prompt against the active
provider and prints the reply — handy for verifying the .env wiring.

If no key is present the app falls back to a `mock` provider that echoes
input; the GUI still runs.

## Current state — what works today

The custom rich-text editor and the flagship AI layer (M0–M3 in the
internal milestone plan) are shipped. Local-storage features (versions,
comments, custom prompts, settings UI) and the read-only-URL publishing
piece are not yet implemented.

### Editor surface

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Type, click-to-position caret, arrow nav, Home/End | ✓ | |
| Mouse drag-select, shift+arrow select, cmd+A | ✓ | |
| Cut / copy / paste (cmd+X / cmd+C / cmd+V) | ✓ | Markdown round-trip on paste |
| Undo / redo (cmd+Z / cmd+shift+Z) | ✓ | Typing runs coalesce; caret motion ends the run |
| Bold / italic / underline / code / strike marks | ✓ | cmd+B / cmd+I / cmd+U / cmd+E / cmd+shift+X |
| Headings H1–H6 | ✓ | cmd+1 / cmd+2 / cmd+3 toggle; backspace at start reverts to paragraph |
| Bullet + ordered lists | ✓ | Round-trip via `Meta{list_kind, depth, index}` |
| Blockquote | ✓ | Renders with muted left bar |
| Fenced code block | ✓ | Monospace + background fill |
| Horizontal rule | ✓ | Renders as a thin line |
| Right-click context menu | ✓ | Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All + Format submenu + AI items |
| File menu shortcuts | ✓ | cmd+N / cmd+O / cmd+S / cmd+shift+S |
| Markdown round-trip (open/save .md) | ✓ | All block + mark types preserved byte-for-byte where feasible |
| YAML front-matter for doc metadata | ✓ | Stores per-doc background instructions |

### AI layer

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic provider (anthropic-sdk-go) | ✓ | Honors per-command temperature |
| OpenAI provider (openai-go) | ✓ | Temperature unset (gpt-5 only accepts default) |
| Mock provider fallback | ✓ | No key → app still runs |
| Provider auto-pick from .env | ✓ | Anthropic preferred when both keys present |
| Streaming AI replacement into selection | ✓ | One undo step regardless of chunk count |
| Command palette (cmd+K) | ✓ | Modal popup with filterable list |
| **Paraphrase** on selection | ✓ | Right-click or palette |
| **Shorten** on selection | ✓ | Right-click or palette |
| **Expand** on selection | ✓ | Right-click or palette |
| **Fix tone (formal)** on selection | ✓ | Right-click or palette |
| **Context-aware Synonyms** for a single word | ✓ | Right-click word → AI returns up to 8 synonyms that fit the sentence |
| Per-document **Background Instructions** | ✓ | AI menu → Background Instructions; stored as YAML front-matter |

### Storage

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite store with WAL + foreign keys | ✓ | At `~/Library/Application Support/fyne-writer/fyne-writer.db` on macOS |
| Schema for settings / versions / comments / prompts | ✓ | Tables exist; UI lands in later milestones |

## Not yet built (roadmap)

In rough order:

- **M4 — AI Checks + Custom Prompts + Settings dialog.** Document-wide
  grammar/style/clarity scan with inline underlines and a sidebar
  Accept/Reject UI. User-defined prompt templates with variables and
  hotkeys. Provider/model picker UI.
- **M5 — Version history + Comments.** Auto-snapshot on save and on
  interval, browse + diff + restore. Anchor comments to text ranges
  with a sidebar list.
- **M6 — Polish.** File-browser sidebar, status bar, keyboard shortcut
  cheatsheet, first-run onboarding, Inter font embedding, performance
  pass on long documents.
- **Deferred to v2 — read-only URL publishing.** Requires a backend
  service (out of scope for v1).

## Known limitations

- **No font embedding yet.** UI falls back to Fyne's default fonts.
  Inter + JetBrains Mono will be embedded in M6 polish.
- **Word wrap measures at the base style.** Heading and code lines may
  overflow the right edge by a few pixels because wrap uses the plain
  body metric. Acceptable for now; visible only at narrow widths.
- **No real-time mark indicator in the status bar.** Pressing cmd+B
  with a collapsed caret sets a pending-marks state but there's no
  visible feedback until you type a character.
- **Lists are flattened during edit.** Nested lists round-trip through
  markdown via `Meta{depth}` but the editor doesn't yet support
  Tab / Shift+Tab to change depth, or Enter-on-empty-item to exit.
- **OpenAI temperature is fixed at the API default.** gpt-5 only
  accepts the default; we drop per-command temperatures rather than
  branching by model. Anthropic still honors per-command temperatures.
- **Synonyms picker is a popup, not an inline submenu.** The AI call
  is async, so we use a follow-up dialog rather than a sub-menu that
  would have to populate after the parent menu closed.
- **Esc doesn't close Fyne's built-in file dialogs (cmd+O / cmd+S).**
  Fyne's `dialog.FileDialog` focuses an internal `widget.Entry` that
  silently consumes Esc, and Fyne's widget-bypassing hooks
  (`canvas.SetOnTypedKey`, `canvas.AddShortcut`) either require no
  focused widget or require a modifier — Esc-without-modifier never
  becomes a `Shortcut`. Workaround for now: click the "Cancel" button.
  Proper fix is a custom file picker that uses our `escEntry` pattern;
  queued for M6 polish. Our own modal popups (cmd+K, Synonyms, etc.)
  already handle Esc correctly.

Tests live alongside the code they cover. As of M3:

- `internal/doc/` — 22 tests (block helpers, mark + block round-trip,
  front-matter, clone, position).
- `internal/editor/` — 14 tests (selection math, mutations, undo
  coalescing).

```sh
go test ./...
```

## Repository layout

- `.env.example` — placeholder for API keys.
- `.gitignore` — excludes the compiled binary, `.env`, and editor scratch.
- `CLAUDE.md` — behavioral guidelines for the AI assistant working on this
  codebase. Worth reading if you're collaborating.
